## session 1
In session one I learnt about the history of computing

I learnt about some important people who are relevant to mechanical computing:

Charles Babbage (1791–1871)
British mathematician, known as the father of computers
Inventor of the Difference Engine
The Difference Engine is considered a key piece of computing history

Ada Lovelace (1815–1852)
Full name: Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace
Regarded as the first computer programmer
Had a long working relationship and friendship with Charles Babbage


I also learnt about the importance of analog computers:

Analog computers laid the groundwork for modern computing techniques and helped solve complex mathmatical problems in a time where digital computers were unable to.
I also learnt that forms of analog computing like optical computing may make a come back due to it being able to be used to simulate neurons


Digital computers:

George Boole Jnr is the creator of Boolean algebra which is extremely important to modern computing
Boolean algebra enables logical decision making in machines
Alan Turing invented the bombe which was used to decode enigma in WW2 through a brute force attack
He also invented the Turing machine which had all the core concepts of the modern computer, it was a model of a CPU


Electronic computers:

Colossus (made in 1943) was the first programmable computer, It was designed to decode the lorenz cipher
ENIAC (electronic numerical intergrator and computer) was the first programmable electronic digital computer, made with 18000 vacuum tubes however several burned out almost every day

Transistors:

The transistor was invented at Bell Laboratories in 1947.
The worlds first transistor computer was built at the university of manchester in november 1953

Early short term memory examples:

1955 magnetic core memory
1964 SRAM
1970 DRAM
1970 ROM
1971 EPROM


Early long term memory examples:

Punched tape
Punched cards
Drum
Disk IBM350 3.75mb
Tape


Atlas computer:

The atlas computer was one of the worlds first supercomputers
In 1962 it was claimed to be the most powerful computer in the world (at the time)
It introduced multiprogramming, Job scheduling, Spooling, Interrupts, Pipelining, Interleaved storage, Virtual storage, Paging and Autonomous transfer units



During this session I also started to learn how git works and created an account on github so that I could create the personal learning diary, I also learnt how to clone a repository.

I also learnt how to set up a rasberry pi and how to connect to the internet on it.


## session 2

Session 2 was focused on computer architecture


Classic von-neumman architecture components:

A processing unit with both an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers
A control unit that includes an instruction register and a program counter
memory that stores data and instructions 
external mass storage
input and output mechanisms

Types of memory on cpu:

Registers
Arithmetic logic unit
Layer 1 cache
Layer 2 cache
Memory management unit

comparing or processing memory in registers is very fast
hitting caches may be a lot slower


Types of memory off cpu:

SRAM/DRAM
disk - HDD / SSD
Removable - Floppy disk / SD card / Tape
Virtual memory



I also learnt about the differnces between X86 and ARM Architecture
These differnces include:

x86 consumes more power
ARM is better for simple tasks however x86 is better for more complex tasks
x86 is found in most desktop computers and laptops but ARM is found more in mobile devices
x86 has variable length instructions with more complex operations where ARM has fixed length instructions (usually 32-bit or 64-bit)

I also got to learn about the rasberry pi through diagrams of it's hardware.

During this session I also learnt how to clone a github repo onto my pc and then merge it with newer branches.

## session 3

In this session I looked deeper into the architecture of the rasberry pi

the GPIO unit on a pi is connected to the 40 pin connector.

In this session I downloaded Node red onto a rasberry pi in order to control LED lights and have them form a traffic light pattern, although we didn't get round to making an automated traffic light system I was able to 

## session 4 (consolidate)


TBD
