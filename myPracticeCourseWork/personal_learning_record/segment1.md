## session 1
In session one I learnt about the history of computing

I learnt about some important people who are relevant to mechanical computing:

Charles Babbage (1791–1871)
British mathematician, known as the father of computers.
Inventor of the Difference Engine.
The Difference Engine is considered a key piece of computing history.

Ada Lovelace (1815–1852)
Full name: Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace.
Regarded as the first computer programmer.
Had a long working relationship and friendship with Charles Babbage.


I also learnt about the importance of analog computers:

Analog computers laid the groundwork for modern computing techniques and helped solve complex mathmatical problems in a time where digital computers were unable to.
I also learnt that forms of analog computing like optical computing may make a come back due to it being able to be used to simulate neurons


Digital computers:

George Boole Jnr is the creator of Boolean algebra which is extremely important to modern computing
Boolean algebra enables logical decision making in machines
Alan Turing invented the bombe which was used to decode enigma in WW2 through a brute force attack
He also invented the Turing machine which had all the core concepts of the modern computer, it was a model of a CPU


Electronic computers:

Colossus (made in 1943) was the first programmable computer, It was designed to decode the lorenz cipher
