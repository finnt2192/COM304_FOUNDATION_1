## session 1
In session one I learnt about the history of computing

I learnt about some important people who are relevant to mechanical computing:

Charles Babbage (1791–1871)
British mathematician, known as the father of computers.
Inventor of the Difference Engine.
The Difference Engine is considered a key piece of computing history.

Ada Lovelace (1815–1852)
Full name: Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace.
Regarded as the first computer programmer.
Had a long working relationship and friendship with Charles Babbage.


I also learnt about the importance of analog computers:

Analog computers laid the groundwork for modern computing techniques and helped solve complex mathmatical problems in a time where digital computers were unable to.
I also learnt that forms of analog computing like optical computing may make a come back due to it being able to be used to simulate neurons
