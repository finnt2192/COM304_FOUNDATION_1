Before starting university I've been doing computing related projects almost my whole life, I started in junior school using basic beginner coding platforms like scratch and very basic python, in secondary school I studied computer science as a GCSE where I learnt more about the hardware of computers and how to build them, I also learnt how to use basic office tools like microsoft word and excel, on top of this I progressed in learning python and general computer knowledge. In college I studied computer science A-level where I learnt how to use visual studio and how to use a different language called visual basic, with visual basic I learnt how to make basic programs for example, a program that prints reciepts based on information inputted into the text boxes. I also learnt the basics of assembly language and various other computer science theory subjects.

In this module I'd love to learn how to code properly since I'm still a beginner in all the languages I want to learn.
