## session 9

In session 9 we were introduced to networking

Modern computer networks use the IP to divide data needing to be communicated into packets which contain multiple bytes

Routers are devices in a network which route packets to their final destination

A network protocol defines rules for formatting and handling data in an electronic communications system

Each network layer has it's own protocol

Protocols in a given layer can be swapped without affecting other layers

The higher layers of the protocol stack are responsible for the end to end communication between applications running on different computers

The lower layers are needed for moving information around the network across multiple subnetworks that are connected by routers

The Application layer defines data formats for application communication between computers

The transport layer defines the data connection quality between the application and it's destination





## session 10

Session 10 was primarily focused on the history of the internet

"Victorian internet" is the telegraph network developed in the 19th century that used morse code to relay messages between stations

In the 1960's to the 1970's the US government needed a communications system that could survive massive disruption so they created DARPA (Defence advanced research projects agency)

In the 1980's to the 1990's early ISPs like AOL and CompuServe started offering home users internet access via phone lines 

In 1991 the first version of HTTP was introduced, however it could only support basic functions like requesting HTML documents from servers

In 1995 AltaVista was established as an early web search engine

In 1995 Amazon opened as an online bookseller

In 1996 HTTP 1.0 was released introducing more features such as the ability to handle different types of data

In 1998 Google Inc was founded

In 1999 HTTP 1.1 provided improvements in performance, caching and persistent connections

In 2001 Wikipedia was launched

In 2005 Youtube was launched

With more and more services starting to be launched on the internet, internet usage shot up as shown in this diagram: (https://imgur.com/a/qRijcUA)
