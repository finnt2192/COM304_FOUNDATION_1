## session 9

In session 9 we were introduced to networking

Modern computer networks use the IP to divide data needing to be communicated into packets which contain multiple bytes

Routers are devices in a network which route packets to their final destination

A network protocol defines rules for formatting and handling data in an electronic communications system

Each network layer has it's own protocol

Protocols in a given layer can be swapped without affecting other layers

The higher layers of the protocol stack are responsible for the end to end communication between applications running on different computers

The lower layers are needed for moving information around the network across multiple subnetworks that are connected by routers

The Application layer defines data formats for application communication between computers

The transport layer defines the data connection quality between the application and it's destination
