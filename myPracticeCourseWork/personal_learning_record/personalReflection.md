At the conclusion of the module I feel like I have significantly improved my knowledge on the areas I thought I was lacking information on. I've learnt: how computer languages work and what types of languages there are, how to use Node RED to have a raspberry pi interact with an LED, how operating systems work and the history of Linux/Unix and how networks work and how data is sent across them using packets.

I feel like I struggled initially with using Git and fixing the issues I came across when trying to synchronise my forked repository with the original repo. I also struggled with learning about machine code and assembly code as I hadn't heard about it much before it was covered in the sessions.

I've done personal research on subjects like the history of the internet and Wayland when I feel like I haven't fully grasped them after the sessions. When I was doing my personal research I found that researching a topic after learning about it in a session helps me remember it a lot better.

To consolidate my knowledge I'll continue to research these topics while putting more focus on the ones I struggled with previously so that I can make sure to remember them. I'll also find ways to put this knowledge into practice, for example I could start researching the different operating systems based on Linux and find one to start using.
